Carbohydrates 2. Lipids 3. Proteins 4. Nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) • Essential to maintaining life processes: cell function, storage, energy, homeostasis and genetic information. → Carbohydrates (short term energy storage) • Made up of sugars and starches • Contain carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen (in a 1:2:1 ratio) • Primary source of energy for cells (used to make ATP) • Can serve as structural materials in organisms • Starches → short-term energy storage • Cellulose → structural support in plants • Sucrose → common sugar (a type of carbohydrate polymer) • Glucose → main monomer (building block) for carbohydrates → Types of Carbohydrates • Carbohydrates are classified according to size. • One sugar is a monosaccharide (monomer). • Two sugars make a disaccharide. • Many sugar molecules linked together form a polysaccharide (polymer). • Monosaccharide: one sugar unit • Examples: • glucose (C 6 ​ H 1 ​ 2 ​ O 6 ​ blood sugar) • deoxyribose • ribose • galactose (milk sugar) • fructose (honey) • Provide cells with energy. • Disaccharide: two sugar units • Example: sucrose → glucose + fructose • Maltose is two glucose molecules; forms in digestive tract of humans during starch digestion. • Polysaccharide: many sugar units (short term energy storage) • Examples: • starch (bread, potatoes) • glycogen (beef muscle) • cellulose (lettuce, corn) • chitin (exoskeletons) • Store energy and provide structural support • Starch is a straight chain of glucose molecules with side branches. → Lipids (long term energy storage) • General term for compounds which are not soluble in water (nonpolar molecules). • Lipids are soluble in hydrophobic solvents. • Remember: "it stores the most energy" • The three types of lipids are fats, oils, and waxes. • Contain carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen • Typically contain two monomers → glycerol and fatty acids. • 5 functions of lipids: 1. Long term energy storage (fat) 2. Protection against heat loss (insulation) 3. Protection against water loss & germs (oils & waxes) 4. Chemical messengers (hormones & steroids) 5.

Adenine 2. Guanine 3. Cytosine 4. Thymine 5. Uracil • The nucleic acid deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) contains genetic information for cell activities. • Ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules play many key roles in building of proteins. Structure: • DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid): • Double-stranded (forms a double helix) • Sugar is deoxyribose • Contains the nitrogen bases A, T, C, and G (adenine, thymine, cytosine, guanine) • RNA (Ribonucleic Acid): • Single-stranded • Sugar is ribose • Contains A, U, C, and G — uracil (U) replaces thymine Function: • DNA stores the genetic blueprint — it holds the instructions for making proteins. • RNA helps carry out those instructions: • mRNA (messenger RNA) copies the DNA code, • tRNA (transfer RNA) brings amino acids to the ribosome, and • rRNA (ribosomal RNA) helps build the protein.`,

    content: `Enzymes → What Are Enzymes? • Enzymes are biological catalysts — specialized proteins that speed up chemical reactions inside living organisms without being consumed or permanently changed. • Each enzyme has a unique structure determined by the specific order of its amino acids, which fold into a precise 3D shape. • This shape determines which substrate(s) the enzyme acts on — making enzymes highly specific. • Most enzyme names end with the suffix “-ase”, which often indicates their substrate: • Sucrase → breaks down sucrose • Lactase → breaks down lactose • Maltase → breaks down maltose • Enzymes are reusable and can catalyze reactions repeatedly as long as conditions remain favorable. → How Do Enzymes Work? • Enzymes lower the activation energy of reactions — the minimum energy needed for reactants to react. • They do this by weakening existing bonds in the substrate, allowing reactions to occur faster and with less energy input. → Enzyme-Substrate Complex • The substrate is the reactant that an enzyme acts upon. • When the substrate binds to the enzyme’s active site, it forms a temporary enzyme-substrate complex, where the reaction occurs. → Active Site & Induced Fit • The active site is the small, specifically shaped region on an enzyme that fits the substrate. • According to the induced fit model, the enzyme slightly changes its shape when the substrate binds, improving the fit and the reaction efficiency. • This flexibility helps explain how enzymes can adapt to slightly different substrates while still maintaining specificity. → Factors Affecting Enzyme Activity 1. Temperature • Increasing temperature generally increases reaction rate because molecules move faster and collide more often. • The reaction reaches its fastest point at the optimum temperature (around 37°C in humans). • Beyond this, enzymes denature — their shape changes and the active site no longer fits the substrate. 2. pH • Each enzyme has an optimum pH, usually around 6–8 for most human enzymes. • Extreme pH values alter the enzyme’s shape, leading to denaturation and loss of function. 3. Substrate and Enzyme Concentration • Increasing either can speed up reactions, but only until all active sites are occupied (enzyme saturation). 4. Ionic Concentration (Salinity) • High or low salt levels can interfere with the ionic bonds maintaining enzyme structure, affecting activity. → Catalysts vs. Enzymes • A catalyst is any substance that speeds up a chemical reaction without being changed itself. • Enzymes are biological catalysts — specialized for reactions in living cells. Example: • Hydrogen peroxide naturally breaks down into water and oxygen: • 2H 2 ​ O 2 ​ → 2H 2 ​ O + O 2 ​ • The enzyme catalase (peroxidase) accelerates this process, producing visible bubbling (oxygen gas). → Importance of Shape (Lock and Key Theory) • The enzyme’s shape determines which substrate it can bind to — similar to how a key fits a specific lock. • If the enzyme denatures (due to heat or pH), the active site shape changes, preventing substrate binding. → Industrial and Biological Uses of Enzymes 1. Biological Washing Powders • Contain proteases and other enzymes that break down stains (like proteins and fats) into smaller, water-soluble pieces. • Allow washing at lower temperatures, saving energy. 2. Food Industry • Pectinase: breaks down cell wall substances in fruit to increase juice yield. • Lactase: breaks down lactose into glucose and galactose — used to make lactose-free milk. 3. Seed Germination • Enzymes help break down stored food (like starch and proteins) into smaller molecules that the growing embryo can use. Acids, Bases, and pH → Acid • A substance that releases hydrogen ions (H + ) when dissolved in water. → Base • A substance that releases hydroxide ions (OH − ) when dissolved in water. → pH Scale • Measures the concentration of hydrogen ions (H + ) in a solution. • pH 7: Neutral (e.g., pure water) • pH < 7: Acidic (higher H + concentration) • pH > 7: Basic or Alkaline (lower H + concentration) → Neutralization • When an acid reacts with a base, the products are a salt and water: • Acid + Base → Salt + Water`,

    content: `The Cell Definition of a Cell • A cell is the smallest unit of life capable of performing all life functions. • Examples: Amoeba proteus, bacteria, nerve cell, plant stem cell, red blood cell. Types of Cells There are two main types of cells: Prokaryotic Cells • Simple cells with no nucleus and no membrane-bound organelles. • DNA floats freely in the cytoplasm. • Usually unicellular organisms like bacteria. • Example: Lactobacillus acidophilus (found in yogurt) Key features: • Few internal structures • Surrounded by a plasma membrane • Very small and visible only under high magnification Eukaryotic Cells • Complex cells that have a true nucleus and membrane-bound organelles. • Found in plants, animals, fungi, and protists. • Much larger and more organized than prokaryotic cells. Animal vs. Plant Cells Feature Animal Cell Plant Cell Shape Round or irregular Rectangular Cell Wall None Present (for structure/support) Chloroplasts Absent Present (for photosynthesis) Vacuoles Small, temporary Large central vacuole Example Muscle cell, nerve cell Leaf cell, root cell Centrioles Present Absent Flagella/Cilia May be present Rare (some algae) Cell Organelles — “The Working Parts of the Cell” Surrounding the Cell Cell Membrane (Plasma Membrane) • The outer boundary of the cell. • Controls what enters and leaves — “the gatekeeper.” • Made of a phospholipid bilayer (Fluid Mosaic Model → Patterns). • Maintains homeostasis by keeping conditions stable inside the cell.

Lysosomes • The cell’s digestive system. • Breaks down wastes, old cell parts, and large molecules. • If they burst, the cell can be destroyed. Vacuoles • Storage sacs for food, water, or waste. • Plant cells have one large central vacuole for storing water and maintaining shape. • Animal cells have smaller vacuoles. Chloroplasts • Found in plant cells only. • Site of photosynthesis — converts sunlight into chemical energy. • Contains green pigment chlorophyll. Centrioles • Found in animal cells (NOT in plant cells) • Paired cylinder-shaped structures located near the nucleus • Help organize cell division by forming spindle fibers that separate chromosomes • Play a key role in mitosis and meiosis Flagella • Long, whip-like structures that extend from the cell surface • Used for cell movement and locomotion • Example: Sperm cells use a flagellum to swim • Longer than cilia, and cells usually have only one or a few flagella Cilia • Short, hair-like structures covering the cell surface • Move in coordinated wave-like motions • Used for movement or moving materials across the cell surface • Example: Cilia in your respiratory tract sweep mucus and debris out of your lungs • Cells typically have many cilia Cell Theory 1. All living things are made of cells. 2. The cell is the basic unit of life. 3. All cells come from pre-existing cells. Key Scientists: • Matthias Schleiden: All plants are made of cells. • Theodor Schwann: All animals are made of cells. • Robert Hooke: Named “cells” after observing cork under a simple microscope. • Anton van Leeuwenhoek: First to observe living cells using a compound microscope.`,

    content: `Cellular Transport The Cell Membrane A. Overview • All cells have a cell membrane. • Functions: 1. Controls what enters and exits the cell to maintain homeostasis (internal balance). 2. Provides protection and structural support. Structure • Lipid Bilayer: two layers of phospholipids • Phosphate head: polar → hydrophilic (“water-loving”) • Fatty acid tails: nonpolar → hydrophobic (“water-fearing”) • Heads face outward (toward water); tails face inward (away from water) • Proteins: embedded in membrane; act as transport channels, receptors, or structural supports. • Carbohydrates: attached to lipids or proteins → act as cell markers for identification. • Cholesterol: stabilizes the membrane and keeps it flexible. Fluid Mosaic Model • “Fluid” → phospholipids and proteins move freely within the layer. • “Mosaic” → made of many different molecules (lipids, proteins, carbs). • Describes the dynamic, flexible nature of the membrane. Selective Permeability • The membrane has pores (holes) that allow only certain molecules through. • Selectively permeable: some molecules pass freely, others are blocked. • The structure (lipid bilayer + proteins) helps determine what enters and exits. Types of Cellular Transport Type Energy Used? Movement Direction Examples Passive Transport ❌ No High → Low concentration Diffusion, Facilitated Diffusion, Osmosis Active Transport ✅ Yes Low → High concentration Protein Pumps, Endocytosis, Exocytosis Passive Transport Movement of molecules without energy (down the concentration gradient). 1. Diffusion • Random movement of molecules from high → low concentration. • Continues until equilibrium (evenly spaced). • Molecules still move at equilibrium but remain evenly distributed. • Moves small, nonpolar molecules like O 2 ​ , CO 2 ​ , and lipids. 2. Facilitated Diffusion • Diffusion of specific particles through transport proteins. • Still passive (no energy needed). • Transport proteins are specific — only allow certain molecules. • Moves larger or charged molecules (e.g., glucose, ions). Two Types of Transport Proteins: 1. Channel proteins: form open pores for molecules to pass through. 2. Carrier proteins: change shape to move molecules across. 3. Osmosis • Diffusion of water through a selectively permeable membrane. • Water moves from high water (low solute) → low water (high solute). • Water moves freely through pores or aquaporins. • Solute particles (like salt or sugar) are too large to move through the membrane. Effects of Osmosis on Cells Type of Solution Definition Water Movement Effect on Cell Hypotonic Solution has low solute, high water outside the cell Water moves into the cell Cell swells and may burst (cytolysis) Hypertonic Solution has high solute, low water outside the cell Water moves out of the cell Cell shrinks (plasmolysis) Isotonic Solute concentration equal inside and outside Water moves equally both directions Cell remains the same size (dynamic equilibrium) Active Transport Requires energy (ATP) to move materials against the concentration gradient (Low → High). 1. Protein Pumps • Transport proteins that require ATP to move molecules across the membrane. • Example: Sodium-Potassium Pump • Pumps Na + out and K + in. • Important for nerve function and maintaining membrane potential. • Protein changes shape during transport (requires energy). 2. Endocytosis • Takes materials into the cell by folding the membrane inward. • Uses energy (ATP). • The membrane surrounds the material and forms a vacuole. Two Main Types: 1. Phagocytosis (“cell eating”) – takes in solids (e.g., how white blood cells engulf bacteria). 2. Pinocytosis (“cell drinking”) – takes in liquids. 3. Exocytosis • Forces materials out of the cell in bulk. • A vesicle containing the material fuses with the cell membrane. • The cell changes shape to release contents → requires energy. • Examples: releasing hormones, digestive enzymes, or wastes. Osmotic Pressure in Living Organisms • Bacteria and plants have cell walls that prevent them from bursting. • Water pressure against the cell wall is called turgor pressure. • Protists (like paramecium) use contractile vacuoles to pump out excess water → prevents over-expansion. • Saltwater fish pump salt out through specialized gills to avoid dehydration. • Animal cells are bathed in isotonic blood plasma; • Kidneys regulate salt and water to maintain balance. Summary Review Table Process Type Energy Needed? Direction (Concentration) Example / Function Diffusion Passive ❌ No High → Low O₂, CO₂ across membrane Facilitated Diffusion Passive ❌ No High → Low Glucose, ions via proteins Osmosis Passive ❌ No High → Low (water) Water balance Protein Pump Active ✅ Yes Low → High Na⁺/K⁺ Pump in nerves Endocytosis Active ✅ Yes Into cell White blood cell engulfing bacteria Exocytosis Active ✅ Yes Out of cell Hormones or wastes released`,

    content: `Cell Division & Reproduction Basic Principles of Cell Division • All cells come from preexisting cells. • Cell division produces two daughter cells from one parent cell. • Daughter cells produced by mitosis are genetically identical to the parent cell. • Chromosomes are the carriers of genetic information. • Chromatin = long strands of DNA wrapped around proteins (histones). Why Cells Divide Cells must divide in order to: 1. Maintain a workable surface area–to–volume ratio so materials can move in and out efficiently. 2. Allow for growth, repair, and replacement of damaged or dead cells. Types of Reproduction Asexual Reproduction • Involves one parent, & produces genetically identical offspring • No genetic variation • Used by: Prokaryotes & Some eukaryotes Sexual Reproduction • Involves two parents and produces genetically unique offspring • Results in high genetic variation • Involves meiosis and fertilization Rate of Cell Division Cell division rate depends on: • Availability of nutrients, enzymes, and proteins • Proper environmental conditions Examples: • Bacteria: divide every ~20 minutes • Skin cells: divide every 18–22 hours Prokaryotic Cell Division (Asexual) Prokaryotes divide by binary fission: • DNA copies • Cell splits into two identical cells • No genetic variation Other asexual methods (some organisms): • Budding – unequal division, bud pinches off • Spore formation – protective structure formed for survival in harsh conditions All asexual reproduction results in clones. Eukaryotic Cell Division Eukaryotic cells divide using: • Mitosis → body cells (asexual reproduction) • Meiosis → sex cells (sexual reproduction) Process Purpose Result Mitosis Growth, repair 2 identical diploid (2n) cells Meiosis Sexual reproduction 4 genetically different haploid (n) cells The Cell Cycle The cell cycle has two major parts: 1. Interphase 2. Cell Division (Mitosis + Cytokinesis) Interphase (Longest Stage) This is when the cell grows and prepares for division. G1 Phase • Cell grows and makes proteins rapidly and organelles S Phase • DNA is replicated • Chromosomes duplicate into sister chromatids • Sister chromatids are connected by a centromere • DNA must be copied so each new cell gets a full, identical set of genes G2 Phase • Cell organizes and prepares for mitosis Mitosis (Nuclear Division) 1. Prophase • Chromosomes condense and become visible • Nuclear membrane breaks down • Centrioles move to opposite poles • Spindle fibers form 2. Metaphase • Chromosomes align at the equator (middle) • Spindle fibers attach to the centromeres 3. Anaphase • Sister chromatids separate • Spindle fibers pull them toward opposite poles 4. Telophase • Chromosomes arrive at opposite poles • Two new nuclei form • Chromosomes uncoil and become chromatin Cytokinesis • The cytoplasm divides • Results in two identical diploid daughter cells Cancer & Cell Division • Cancer is a disease of uncontrolled mitosis. • Occurs when cell cycle checkpoints fail. • A normal cell becomes a cancer cell due to DNA mutations. • Cancer cells: • Divide without control • Ignore normal stopping signals • Can become immortal (normal cells divide ~50 times, but cancer cells can divide forever) Tumors • A tumor is a mass of cancer cells. • Tumors cause angiogenesis (growth of new blood vessels). • At ~1 million cells, a tumor is around the size of a BB pellet. Types of Tumors • Benign – remains at original site • Malignant – spreads to other tissues (metastasis) via bloodstream or lymph Mitosis is critical to cancer research because cancer is uncontrolled mitosis. Meiosis (Sexual Reproduction) • Used to form gametes (sex cells) • Gametes must be haploid (n) and body cells are diploid (2n) • Two parents contribute a set of chromosomes each through gametes • Together they form a zygote (diploid) • Homologous chromosomes: control the same traits • Not necessarily identical genes Meiosis I (Reduction Division) Prophase I • Homologous chromosomes pair and crossing over occurs • Creates genetic variation Metaphase I • Homologous pairs line up randomly at the equator • Independent assortment increases variation Anaphase I • Homologous chromosomes separate • Sister chromatids remain together Telophase I • Two haploid cells form No interphase before Meiosis II Meiosis II • Functions just like mitosis • Sister chromatids separate • Results in four genetically different haploid cells Human Chromosomes • Humans have 46 chromosomes (23 pairs) • Autosomes = pairs 1–22 • Sex chromosomes = pair 23 • Female: XX • Male: XY • Each homologous pair contains: • One chromosome from each parent Mitosis vs. Meiosis Summary Feature Mitosis Meiosis Purpose Growth, repair Sexual reproduction Number of divisions 1 2 Daughter cells 2 4 Chromosome number Diploid (2n) Haploid (n) Genetic makeup Identical Different Chromosomal Mutations • Deletion – a piece of chromosome is lost • Inversion – piece breaks off and reinserts backward • Translocation – piece attaches to a different chromosome These mutations may cause genetic disorders. Karyotypes • A karyotype shows the number, size, and shape of chromosomes • Used to identify genetic disorders such as Down syndrome (Trisomy 21)`,

It: • Controls all chemical activities inside cells • Determines what type of cell forms (muscle, nerve, blood, etc.) • Determines what type of organism develops (human, fish, plant, etc.) • Stores instructions for making proteins DNA is found in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells (prokaryotes have DNA but no nucleus).

Nitrogen base The Four DNA Bases There are four nitrogen bases: • A = Adenine • T = Thymine • G = Guanine • C = Cytosine Complementary Base Pairing DNA follows strict pairing rules: • A pairs with T (2 hydrogen bonds) • C pairs with G (3 hydrogen bonds) This pairing allows DNA to: • Be copied accurately • Store information in its sequence of bases DNA Shape DNA has a double helix shape (twisted ladder). • The sides are made of alternating sugar and phosphate • The rungs are made of paired nitrogen bases (A–T and C–G) DNA’s structure was described by Watson and Crick, based on the work of Rosalind Franklin. DNA Replication DNA replication occurs before a cell divides so each new cell gets a complete copy of DNA. Purpose • Ensures all body cells have the same genetic information • Allows DNA to be passed to offspring Steps of Replication 1. Helicase unwinds and unzips the DNA by breaking hydrogen bonds. 2. Each original strand acts as a template. 3. DNA polymerase: • Adds complementary nucleotides (A–T, C–G) • Proofreads and fixes errors 4. DNA ligase bonds the nucleotides together. 5. Two identical DNA molecules are produced. Replication is extremely accurate — about 1 error per billion nucleotides. RNA (Ribonucleic Acid) RNA is used to carry and interpret DNA’s instructions to make proteins. How RNA differs from DNA DNA RNA Double-stranded Single-stranded Deoxyribose sugar Ribose sugar Uses thymine (T) Uses uracil (U) Stays in nucleus Can leave nucleus RNA base pairing • A pairs with U • C pairs with G Types of RNA Three types of RNA are involved in making proteins: Type Function mRNA (messenger) Carries instructions from DNA to ribosome rRNA (ribosomal) Forms the ribosome tRNA (transfer) Brings amino acids to ribosome Protein Synthesis Protein synthesis has two stages: 1. Transcription (DNA → RNA) 2. Translation (RNA → Protein Transcription (DNA → mRNA) Occurs in the nucleus. Steps 1. DNA unwinds in a gene region. 2. mRNA is built by pairing with the DNA template: • A → U • T → A • C → G • G → C 3. mRNA detaches and leaves the nucleus. 4. mRNA travels to a ribosome. The Genetic Code • Every 3 bases on mRNA is a codon • Each codon codes for one amino acid • There are 64 codons • 61 code for amino acids • 3 are stop signals • AUG is the start codon (codes for methionine) Translation (mRNA → Protein) Occurs at the ribosome in the cytoplasm. Steps 1. mRNA binds to the ribosome. 2. tRNA brings amino acids to the ribosome. 3. The anticodon on tRNA matches the codon on mRNA. 4. Amino acids are joined together to form a polypeptide. 5. The chain continues growing until a stop codon is reached. 6. The completed protein is released. Why Proteins Matter Proteins: • Build cell structures • Act as enzymes • Control chemical reactions • Determine traits DNA doesn’t do the work — proteins do. DNA just provides the instructions.`,

    content: `Mutations What Are Mutations? • Mutations are changes in the nucleotide sequence of DNA. • They can occur: • In somatic (body) cells → not inherited • In gametes (sperm or egg cells) → can be passed to offspring • Mutations are a major source of genetic variation in populations. Are Mutations Helpful or Harmful? • Mutations occur regularly and naturally during DNA replication. • Most mutations are neutral, meaning they have no noticeable effect. • Some mutations are harmful, causing diseases or disorders. • A small number are beneficial, improving survival or reproduction. • Mutagens (agents that cause mutations) include: • UV radiation • Chemicals • Viruses • Cells have DNA repair enzymes that fix many mutations before they cause damage. • Examples of mutation-related diseases: • Skin cancer (often caused by UV damage in somatic cells) • Leukemia (caused by mutations affecting blood cell production) Types of Mutations 1. Chromosome Mutations • Involve large-scale changes to chromosomes. • May include: • Changes in chromosome structure • Loss or gain of chromosome segments • Often affect many genes at once, making them more severe. Types of Chromosome Mutations Deletion • A segment of a chromosome breaks off and is lost. • Results in missing genes. Inversion • A chromosome segment breaks off, flips, and reattaches. • Gene order is reversed, which can disrupt gene function. Duplication • A segment of a chromosome is copied and repeated. • Results in extra gene copies. Translocation • A segment of one chromosome moves to a non-homologous chromosome. • Can disrupt genes or create abnormal gene regulation. Nondisjunction • Failure of chromosomes to separate properly during meiosis. • Causes gametes with too many or too few chromosomes. • Leads to genetic disorders caused by abnormal chromosome numbers. Examples of Nondisjunction Disorders • Down Syndrome: three copies of chromosome 21 (Trisomy 21) • Turner Syndrome: only one X chromosome (XO) • Klinefelter Syndrome: extra sex chromosome (XXY) 2. Gene Mutations • Changes in the nucleotide sequence of a single gene. • Usually affect one protein. • Caused by: • DNA replication errors • Chemicals • Radiation • Viruses Types of Gene Mutations Point Mutations • Change in one single nucleotide. • Often involves substitution (one base replaces another). • May be: • Neutral • Harmful • Rarely beneficial • Not always guaranteed to cause a disorder. Example: Sickle Cell Disease • Caused by a single nucleotide substitution in the hemoglobin gene. • Changes the shape of red blood cells, affecting oxygen transport. Frameshift Mutations • Caused by insertion or deletion of one or more nucleotides. • Shifts the reading frame of the gene. • Affects every codon after the mutation, usually resulting in a nonfunctional protein. • Almost always harmful. Example • Original sentence: The fat cat ate the wee rat • Frameshift (extra “a” added): The fat caa tat eth ewe era t • Meaning is lost, similar to how protein instructions are disrupted.`,
