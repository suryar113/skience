    content: `Living things are highly organized, meaning they contain specialized, coordinated parts. All living organisms are made up of one or more cells. Unicellular organisms consist of only a single cell, whereas multicellular organisms consist of many cells. The cells in multicellular organisms may be specialized to perform different functions. A group of cells that perform the same function is known as a tissue. A group of tissues that perform the same function is known as an organ. A group of organs that perform the same function is known as an organ system. Organisms have the ability to respond to stimuli from their environment. They can also reproduce, meaning they can produce offspring. DNA is passed down from parent to offspring. Over time, populations of organisms can adapt to their environment through evolution by natural selection. Homeostasis is the ability of an organism to maintain constant internal conditions. For example, many organisms regulate their body temperature in a process known as thermoregulation.`,

    content: `The four main types of organic molecules are carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. Carbohydrates are made up of monosaccharides and are used for energy. Lipids include fats and oils, and are used for energy storage and insulation. Proteins are made up of amino acids and have a wide variety of functions, including acting as enzymes, structural components, and transport molecules. Nucleic acids, such as DNA and RNA, are made up of nucleotides and store and transmit genetic information. Carbon's ability to form stable bonds with four other atoms makes it the ideal backbone for these complex molecules.`,

    content: `Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in living organisms. They are typically proteins, and each enzyme is specific to the reaction it catalyzes. The molecule that an enzyme acts on is called the substrate. The substrate binds to a specific region of the enzyme called the active site. The enzyme-substrate complex undergoes a chemical reaction, and the enzyme releases the product(s). Enzyme activity is affected by temperature, pH, and the concentration of the substrate and enzyme. Denaturation is a process in which the protein structure of an enzyme is altered, resulting in a loss of activity.`,

    content: `The cell is the basic structural and functional unit of all known living organisms. There are two main types of cells: prokaryotic and eukaryotic. Prokaryotic cells are simpler and smaller than eukaryotic cells, and they lack a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles. Eukaryotic cells have a true nucleus, which contains the cell's genetic material, and they also have other membrane-bound organelles, such as mitochondria, chloroplasts, and the endoplasmic reticulum. The plasma membrane surrounds all cells and regulates the passage of substances into and out of the cell. The cytoplasm is the jelly-like substance that fills the cell and surrounds the organelles.`,

    content: `Cellular transport refers to the movement of substances across the cell membrane. There are two main types of cellular transport: passive transport and active transport. Passive transport does not require energy and includes diffusion, osmosis, and facilitated diffusion. Diffusion is the movement of a substance from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. Osmosis is the diffusion of water across a selectively permeable membrane. Facilitated diffusion is the movement of a substance across a membrane with the help of a transport protein. Active transport requires energy in the form of ATP and includes the sodium-potassium pump and endocytosis.`,

    content: `Cells require a constant supply of energy to carry out their various functions. This energy is primarily derived from the breakdown of glucose in a process called cellular respiration. Cellular respiration has three main stages: glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and the electron transport chain. Glycolysis takes place in the cytoplasm and breaks down glucose into two molecules of pyruvate. The Krebs cycle takes place in the mitochondria and completes the breakdown of glucose. The electron transport chain, also in the mitochondria, is where most of the ATP is produced. Photosynthesis is the process by which plants and other organisms use sunlight to synthesize foods from carbon dioxide and water.`,

    content: `Cell division is the process by which a parent cell divides into two or more daughter cells. Cell division is essential for growth, repair, and reproduction. There are two main types of cell division: mitosis and meiosis. Mitosis is a type of cell division that results in two daughter cells each having the same number and kind of chromosomes as the parent nucleus, typical of ordinary tissue growth. Meiosis is a type of cell division that results in four daughter cells each with half the number of chromosomes of the parent cell, as in the production of gametes and plant spores. The cell cycle is the series of events that take place in a cell leading to its division and duplication of its DNA (DNA replication) to produce two daughter cells.`,
